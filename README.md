# Price-Tracker-bot
I have made a price tracker bot using beatifulSoup (a python library for web scrapping) 
How This Bot will work? 

Well the bot will first ask the site name that the product belong to. 
Then it will ask for the url of the product , then it will ask for the email id of the user. 
The bot will check in every 12 hours if the price of the perticular product has decreased or not 
If it does then the bot will send an email to notify the user to its respective email-id that the price has decreased
